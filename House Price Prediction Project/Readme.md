# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression 🏠💰

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! In this project, we'll explore and analyze a dataset containing various features related to houses and use a Linear Regression model to predict house prices. Let's get started! 🚀

## Project Overview 📋

This project focuses on predicting house prices using the Linear Regression algorithm. We'll go through the following steps:

1. **Importing the Required Libraries** 📚
   - We'll import essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to facilitate data manipulation, visualization, and model building.

2. **Loading the Dataset** 📊
   - We'll load the House Price Prediction dataset from a CSV file.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍
   - We'll perform initial data exploration by examining the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and correlations between variables.
   - Visualizations will help us understand the relationships between numerical features.

4. **Feature Extraction** 📈
   - We'll select relevant features from the dataset to use as input for our Linear Regression model.

5. **Splitting the Dataset** 📂
   - We'll split the dataset into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function.

6. **Fitting the Linear Regression Model** 📉
   - We'll create a Linear Regression model using the training data and fit it to predict house prices.

7. **Metrics Evaluation** 📊
   - We'll evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

8. **Visualization of Predictions** 📈
   - We'll visualize the model's predictions against actual prices to observe its accuracy.

9. **Residual Analysis** 📊
   - We'll analyze the residuals (the differences between predicted and actual prices) to ensure the model's performance.

10. **Prediction for New Data** 🧐
    - We'll provide a way for users to input new data and predict house prices using the trained model.
