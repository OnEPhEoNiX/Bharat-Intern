## Introduction

Get ready to explore the world of wines! 🍇 This project uses various machine learning techniques to predict whether a wine is 👍 "Good" or 👎 "Not-so-good" based on its characteristics. The dataset includes properties like acidity, alcohol content, and more.

## Getting Started

Import pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib to kickstart your wine journey. 🚀 Load the wine quality dataset and set up interactive plots using `%matplotlib inline`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's uncork the data! 🍾 Peek at the data's first and last sips, check its shape, and clear any missing values. Unveil the distribution of wine 🍷 "type" and "quality".

## Data Cleaning

Time to clean the wine glasses! 🧼 Transform categorical features into dummy variables and witness the normalization of "type" and "quality" attributes.

## Visualization

Get your wine goggles on! 🕶️ Visualize the counts of "type" and "quality". Dive into distribution plots, box plots, and bar plots to understand feature relationships. Cheers to pair plots and a heatmap showing the correlations!

## Standardization

Standardize the flavors! 🍷 Drop "total sulfur dioxide" and let the StandardScaler work its magic to standardize features.

## Splitting Dataset

Prepare for a delightful blend! 🍹 Use `train_test_split` to create a balanced mix of training and testing sets.

## Predictions

Unleash the algorithms! 🎰 Make predictions using Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. Taste the accuracy, explore classification reports, confusion matrices, and R-squared values.

## Predicting with User Input

Pour your input, predict your quality! 🧪 Gather user inputs for wine characteristics, transform and standardize them, then use the trained model to predict wine quality. Are you sipping on a "Good" or "Not-so-good" prediction? 🍾

🍇 Sip wisely and enjoy your journey into the world of wine quality prediction! 🌟
